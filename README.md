Playing around with multiclass classification of Costa Rican household dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction)

### Latest model is illustrated in /notebooks/09_second_model_expand_pipelines.ipynb

## TODO 
- More feature engineering (especially household aggregations of individual-level characteristics) 
    - including intelligent features re dummy variables on housing materials, electricity sources, etc
- Automated feature selection
- Learning Curves
- Add more complex algorithms
- Systematic comparison of more algorithms
- Research: would oversampling of rare groups help, or is using a macro F1 score already weighting properly?
